Cabrera\u2019s father, who became an accomplished dramaturge and actor, fled Fascist Spain as a teen-ager; Cabrera himself, along with his sister and their parents, would leave Colombia decades later, when changing political winds made their Communist sympathies a liability. For part of Cabrera\u2019s adolescence, the family of fervent Marxists lived in Beijing, residing in a plush, cloistered compound reserved exclusively for foreigners. When Cabrera attends a retrospective of his work in Barcelona, in 2016, he reflects on this history, on his family\u2019s resentments, and on how intensely held\u2014if impermanent\u2014political convictions inflect individual lives."),(0,i.kt)("h3",{id:"--\u4e5d\u680b-by-\u90b9\u9759\u4e4b"},"[ ]"," \u4e5d\u680b by \u90b9\u9759\u4e4b"),(0,i.kt)("h3",{id:"--wasteland"},"[ ]"," Wasteland"),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"by Oliver Franklin-Wallis (Hachette)\nNonfiction\nThe British journalist Oliver Franklin-Wallis used to religiously rinse his plastics before depositing them in one of the color-coded rubbish bins that he and his wife kept at their home. Then he decided to find out what was actually happening to his garbage. Disenchantment followed. At a recycling plant, in New Delhi, he found workers feeding shredded junk into an extruder, which pumped out little gray microplastic pellets known as nurdles. He toured another recycling plant, in northern England, where he learned that nearly half the bales of plastic matter it receives can\u2019t be reprocessed because they\u2019re too contaminated. In the end, Franklin-Wallis comes to see plastic recycling as smoke and mirrors. Over the years, he writes, \u201ca kind of playbook\u201d has emerged: a company pledges to insure that the packaging for its products gets recycled. Then, when public pressure eases, it quietly abandons its promise and lobbies against any legislation to restrict the use of single-use plastics. Franklin-Wallis quotes a telling remark from Larry Thomas, the former president of the Society of the Plastics Industry: \u201cIf the public thinks recycling is working, then they are not going to be as concerned about the environment.\u201d"),(0,i.kt)("h3",{id:"-the-art-thief"},"[ ]","The Art Thief"),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"by Michael Finkel (Knopf)\nNonfiction\nFrom 1994 to 2001, St\xe9phane Breitwieser stole art at an unprecedented pace: three out of four weekends per year for eight years. He plied his craft during business hours, in museums, galleries, and auction houses, with tourists and docents and security guards milling around. He never wore a mask. He carried no weapons. And he stole some two billion dollars\u2019 worth of art. Michael Finkel wonderfully narrates this odds-defying crime streak, whose trajectory is less rise and fall than crazy and crazier, propelled by suspense and surprises. Breitwieser pulls off his thefts with surprising minimalism. There is no rappelling from roofs, no triggering of fire alarms, no high-tech devices to shut down security systems. His gear consists chiefly of a Swiss Army knife and, weather permitting, an overcoat. In the book\u2019s final chapters\u2014when the dashing antihero grows old and sad\u2014Finkel does not hesitate to bring down the boom, but he is clear and compassionate about the downfall. An outrageous tale, \u201cThe Art Thief,\u201d like its title character, has confidence, \xe9lan, and a great sense of timing."))}p.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
