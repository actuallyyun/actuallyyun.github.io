I was trying to update it, but really struggled with Jkyll. To run the site locally, I had to install Ruby, a version manager for Ruby, a Bundler and some other things. \\n\\nTo be able to run the site locally while working on it is absolutely crucial for productivity\'s sake. \\n\\nThen I remembered Docusarus from the documentation site of Open Beta. Recently I updated some of OB\'s documentation and had a really good time working with the code. \\n\\nAfter some very quick digging, I realized that Docusarus is perfect for my use-case: it\'s node based, uses tools I am already familiar with and love using. It\'s lightweight(in comparision to `Next.js`) and can be deployed to Github Pages as well.\\n\\nI spent about an hour or so playing with it, and successfully deployed it to GH pages and it\'s live! \\n\\nComparing to the other times when I tried to set up a blog, `Docusarus` is very easy to use and well-documented. \\n\\nFor this project, I try to follow an iterative approach. Meaning building an end to end product as soon as possible, then incrementally improve it. \\n\\nToday what I did was:\\n\\n- Step 1: deploy a live blog\\n- Step 2: add basic personalized styling\\n- Step 3: the very first post(this one!)"}]}')}}]);
