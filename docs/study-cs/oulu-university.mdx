### General Requirements for an international candidate

Assuming you don't have Finnish education qualifications. To apply for University of Oulu with a non-Finnish qualification, you have the following options:

- [ ] a foreign qualification that provides eligibility for higher education studies in the awarding country

- [ ] an International Baccalaureate (IB) diploma completed outside of Finland

...

- [x] a Finnish or **foreign higher education degree (Bachelor's, Master's, Licenciate, PhD)**

Since I already have a Bachelor and a Master's degree, I could use this qualification.

Because it's an international program, English language requirements must be met. 

The common English language tests such as *IELTS, TOEFEL, Pearson Test, etc* are all going to work. On top of that, completing a Basic or Uppser Secondary Education or higher in English in EU/EEA, Australia, Canada, GB, Ireland, New Zealand, or the US also works. 

> The degree must be completed in EU/EEA country, Australia, Canada, Great Britain, Ireland, New Zealand, or the United States, excluding online degrees and offshore campuses.
> Please note that the document must clearly state that the language of education is English
> Upload a copy of the transcript of records of Bachelor, Master or Doctoral`s degree conducted in English language to the electronic application. If original document is not issued in English, Finnish or Swedish, translation to one of the languages is also required.

Since I completed a Master's degree in English in Spain, I could use this to prove my English ability. 

These are the general requirements, luckliy I meet all of those. What's even better is that I won't have to take addtional exams to apply.

### Specific requirements for the CS program

The degress is named **Bachelor's in Digitalisation, Computing and Electronics**.

<Image img={programInfo}/>

1. There are three paths in this program, the one I'm interested in is **Computer Science and Engineering studies**.

2. It's a 3+2 program, 3 years of bachelor, and 2 years of master is followed. 

3. The Next application period is: 3-17 January 2024

4. And it requires SAT test unless *you have Finnish matriculation examination, IB, EB or DIA/RP*. I am not sure if a EU master's degree will exempt me from this rule. If not, I will have a take a SAT exam.

[SAT test in Finland info](https://satsuite.collegeboard.org/sat) can be found here. It seems like they offer online test, and the test fee is 103 USD. Seems reseanable.

### Scholarships

If accepted, I can apply for Nokia scholarship of 3000 EUR.

:::note
You must apply for the Scholarship on the same online application you use for applying to these programmes in Studyinfo (Application form open: January 4th - January 18th, 2023, 15:00/3pm UTC+2).
