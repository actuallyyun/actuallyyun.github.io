Continue working on my coding blog.

### Done
- Added some customized styles.(yes purple!!)
- Added more categories to docs folder

### To-Do
- [ ] Migrate my posts to this site(write a script to do it?)


### Backlog
- [ ] Eventually,figure out how to rename `/docs` to `/coding`. Not in a rush though.


### Daily Nuggets
- Markdown front matter example
